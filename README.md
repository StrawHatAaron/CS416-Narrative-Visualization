### FRED tends to organize body types into three major categories, especially from a statistical and regulatory standpoint:

##### ðŸš— Autos (Passenger Cars)
- Includes sedans, hatchbacks, station wagons, and coupes
- Focused on personal transportation
- Lower ground clearance and lighter frame
- Examples: Honda Civic, Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry


##### ðŸ›» Lightweight Trucks
- Includes SUVs, crossovers, minivans, and pickups
- Must weigh less than 10,000 lbs (GVWRâ€”Gross Vehicle Weight Rating)
- Used for both personal and light commercial purposes
- Examples: Toyota RAV4, Ford F-150, Jeep Grand Cherokee


##### ðŸšš Heavyweight Trucks
- Includes large pickups, box trucks, semis, and other commercial vehicles
- Typically weigh more than 10,000 lbs GVWR
- Mostly for business/fleet use: freight, construction, etc.
- Examples: Ford Super Duty (F-450+), Freightliner Cascadia, Ram 5500
So even though the retail world might advertise by styleâ€”like "sports sedan" or "luxury SUV"â€”FRED keeps it lean and structured around function and weight class. Want to plot a historical trend comparing how consumer preferences shifted between these categories? We could build something in D3 or Tableau that'll reveal some really cool patterns.
